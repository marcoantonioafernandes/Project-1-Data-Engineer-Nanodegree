## General info
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data theyâ€™ve been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.
This project performs the extraction and transformation of data coming from user logs and music plays from sparkify's music streaming app. In addition, we carry out the modeling of a dimensional database using star schema modeling. Finally, the project loads the transformed data in this database for further analysis of this information. The image below shows the data model.

## Code examples

Database queries: 
1. What are the most played songs?
```
SELECT s.title, COUNT(*) as playsBySong
	FROM songplays sp
	INNER JOIN songs s
	ON sp.song_id = s.song_id
group by s.song_id;
```


2. Which artists are the most listened to?
```
SELECT a.name, COUNT(*) as playsByArtist
	FROM songplays sp
	INNER JOIN artists as a
	ON sp.artist_id = a.artist_id
group by a.artist_id;
```


3. What is the most used browser?
```
SELECT user_agent, COUNT(*) playsByNavigator 
	FROM songplays
GROUP BY user_agent;
```

4. What are the locations with the highest number of music plays?
```
SELECT location, COUNT(*) playsByLocation 
	FROM songplays
GROUP BY location;
```


5. What are the locations with the highest number of music plays?
```
SELECT s.year, COUNT(*) as numberOfSongs
	FROM songplays sp
	INNER JOIN songs s
	ON sp.song_id = s.song_id
group by s.year;
```


6. What are the most listened to songs by gender?

```
SELECT s.title, COUNT(*) as playsBySong
	FROM songplays sp
	INNER JOIN songs s
	ON sp.song_id = s.song_id
	
	INNER JOIN users u
	on sp.user_id = u.user_id
WHERE gender = 'F'
group by s.song_id;

SELECT s.title, COUNT(*) as playsBySong
	FROM songplays sp
	INNER JOIN songs s
	ON sp.song_id = s.song_id
	
	INNER JOIN users u
	on sp.user_id = u.user_id
WHERE gender = 'M'
group by s.song_id;
```
